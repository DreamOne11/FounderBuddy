# Mission Pitch Conversation Flow

Based on the prompts, here's the complete conversation flow for the Mission Pitch agent:

## Overview: 90-Second Mission Pitch Framework

The agent guides users through 6 core components + implementation to create a compelling 90-second Mission Pitch.

---

## Section 1: Hidden Theme (15-20 words)
**Goal**: Discover the 1-sentence recurring pattern that defines their life and work

### Opening Message:
```
Let's start by discovering your Hidden Theme.

The Hidden Theme is a single sentence that captures a recurring pattern in your life - something that shows up in your childhood, career choices, hobbies, and the problems you're naturally drawn to solve.

Think of it as the thing people who know you well would say: "That's so typical of [your name] - they always..."

To get there, I want you to choose one of these sentence starters and give me a 2-3 minute rant:

• "I've always been the person who..."
• "What really gets under my skin is when..."  
• "Since I was young, I've noticed..."
• "The pattern in my life has been..."

Just start talking and see where it goes.
```

### Process Flow:
1. **Rant Collection** - User chooses starter and provides 2-3 minute rant
2. **Theme Extraction** - Agent analyzes and presents 2-3 theme options (15-20 words each)
3. **Theme Selection** - User chooses preferred theme
4. **Confidence Check** - User rates confidence 0-5 (must be ≥3)
5. **Summary & Rating** - Show final theme, ask for satisfaction rating ≥3

### Example Theme Sentences:
- "I find hidden connections others miss and turn them into opportunities"
- "I help overwhelmed leaders find clarity by cutting through the noise"
- "I see potential in broken systems and can't help but try to fix them"

## Key Conversation Rules Throughout:

### Communication Style:
- Direct, plain language (no buzzwords)
- One question at a time (critical rule)
- No praise or congratulations
- Focus on concrete specifics
- Everything is a "working draft" for testing

### Router Directives:
- **"stay"**: Continue current section, rating < 3, or content modification
- **"next"**: Section complete + satisfaction rating ≥ 3
- **"modify:section_name"**: User requests different section

### Rating System:
- **0-2**: Not satisfied, let's refine this section
- **3-5**: Satisfied, ready to move to next section

### Critical Rules:
- NEVER ask multiple questions at once
- NEVER proceed without required elements
- NEVER use "next" until satisfaction ≥ 3
- Always distinguish section jumping vs. content modification

This creates a structured yet conversational flow that systematically builds a compelling 90-second Mission Pitch through guided discovery and refinement.
